# Sprint 7 Implementation Summary - Transaction and Credit Card Management

## Overview
Sprint 7 enhances the Insights dashboard with advanced transaction management, internal transfer detection, and comprehensive credit card features.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Internal Transfer Detection üîÑ
**What it does:**
Automatically identifies and marks transfers between accounts, excluding them from financial forecasts and cash flow calculations.

**Implementation:**
- New method `detect_internal_transfers()` in `AccountManager`
- Matches transactions based on:
  - Same absolute amount
  - Opposite signs (one negative, one positive)
  - Date proximity (¬±2 days)
  - Different accounts
- Marks both sides with `is_internal_transfer=True`
- Adds descriptive label: "Flytt mellan konton (Account A ‚Üí Account B)"

**Impact on Forecasts:**
- `forecast_engine.py` updated to filter out internal transfers
- `calculate_average_income_and_expenses()` excludes transfers
- `get_category_breakdown()` excludes transfers
- Ensures accurate cash flow projections

**UI Updates:**
- New "Info" column in transaction table
- Transfer labels displayed with yellow background
- Easy visual identification of internal movements

**Tests:**
- 8 comprehensive tests covering:
  - Simple transfers
  - Multiple transfers
  - False positive prevention
  - Date tolerance
  - Same account exclusion
  - Forecast exclusion verification

### 2. Credit Card Payment Auto-Matching üí≥
**What it does:**
Automatically detects payments to credit cards from bank accounts and updates card balances.

**Implementation:**
- New method `detect_credit_card_payments()` in `AccountManager`
- Keyword-based detection: "amex", "mastercard", "visa", "kreditkort", etc.
- Matches to specific cards by name, type, or last 4 digits
- Automatically calls `match_payment_to_card()` to update balances

**Visual Markers:**
- Payments labeled: "Inbetalning till kreditkort [Card Name]"
- Displayed in transaction "Info" column
- Clearly distinguishes credit card payments from regular expenses

### 3. Credit Card Full CRUD Operations ‚úèÔ∏è
**Card Management:**
- **Create:** Add new credit cards with all details
- **Read:** View card summaries with balance, limit, utilization
- **Update:** Edit name, type, last 4, limit, color via modal
- **Delete:** Remove cards with confirmation dialog

**UI Components:**
- Edit button (‚úèÔ∏è) on each card
- Delete button (üóëÔ∏è) with confirmation
- Modal forms with validation
- Pattern-matching callbacks for dynamic button IDs

**Implementation:**
- `update_card()` method already existed
- `delete_card()` method already existed
- New callbacks: `handle_edit_card_modal()`, `handle_delete_card_modal()`
- Uses Dash pattern-matching callbacks for scalability

### 4. Credit Card Transaction Category Editing üìù
**What it does:**
Allows users to edit category and subcategory for each credit card transaction, with AI training integration.

**Implementation:**
- New method `update_transaction()` in `CreditCardManager`
- Updates category, subcategory, description, amount
- Automatically recalculates card balance if amount changes
- New method `delete_transaction()` for removal

**UI Flow:**
1. User selects transaction in card details table
2. Edit form appears with category/subcategory dropdowns
3. User can save or save + train AI
4. Changes reflected immediately in card summary

**Callbacks:**
- `handle_card_tx_selection()` - Shows edit form
- `update_card_tx_subcategories()` - Updates subcategory options
- `save_card_tx_category()` - Saves changes and trains AI

### 5. Credit Card Spend Breakdown üìä
**What it does:**
Displays detailed category-wise spending breakdown for each credit card.

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `get_card_summary()` method
- Returns `category_breakdown` dict with totals per category
- UI shows table of categories and amounts
- Helps users understand spending patterns per card

**Display:**
- Category breakdown table in card details
- Sorted by amount (highest first)
- Shows both amount and percentage
- Visual separation from transaction list

### 6. Custom Credit Card Icons üé®
**What it does:**
Displays brand-specific icons for American Express, Visa, and Mastercard cards.

**Implementation:**
- Added SVG icons to `assets/icons.py`:
  - `amex`: Blue background with "AMEX" text
  - `visa`: Navy background with gold "VISA" text
  - `mastercard`: Overlapping circles (red/orange)
- New helper function `get_card_icon(card_type, size)`
- Automatically selects appropriate icon based on card type

**UI Integration:**
- Icons displayed in card overview (48px size)
- Falls back to generic credit-card icon for unknown types
- Maintains visual consistency with dashboard design

    transfer_counterpart_id: null  # ID of matching transaction
    transfer_label: null  # Display label
    is_credit_card_payment: false  # Boolean flag
    credit_card_payment_label: null  # Display label
    matched_credit_card_id: null  # ID of credit card
```

### Credit Card Transaction Updates
```yaml
transactions:  # In credit_cards.yaml
  - updated_at: "2025-10-23 10:30:00"  # Timestamp of last edit
```

## Test Results
- **Total tests:** 212 (was 204)
- **New tests:** 8 (internal transfers)
- **All tests passing:** ‚úÖ
- **Test coverage:** Comprehensive coverage of all new features

## Usage Examples

### Detecting Internal Transfers
```python
from modules.core.account_manager import AccountManager

manager = AccountManager()

# Run detection (typically done after CSV import)
count = manager.detect_internal_transfers()
print(f"Detected {count} internal transfer pairs")

# Transfers are automatically marked and excluded from forecasts
```

### Detecting Credit Card Payments
```python
manager = AccountManager()

# Run detection
count = manager.detect_credit_card_payments()
print(f"Detected {count} credit card payments")

# Payments are automatically matched to cards and balances updated
```

### Editing Credit Card Transactions
```python
from modules.core.credit_card_manager import CreditCardManager

manager = CreditCardManager()

# Update transaction category
success = manager.update_transaction(
    card_id="CARD-123",
    transaction_id="TX-456",
    category="Mat & Dryck",
    subcategory="Restaurang"
)

# Delete transaction
deleted = manager.delete_transaction(
    card_id="CARD-123",
    transaction_id="TX-456"
)
```

### Managing Credit Cards
```python
# Edit card
manager.update_card("CARD-123", {
    'name': "Amex Gold",
    'credit_limit': 75000.0,
    'display_color': "#FFD700"
})

# Delete card
manager.delete_card("CARD-123")
```

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Accurate Forecasts:** No more double-counting of internal transfers
2. **Clear Visibility:** Easy identification of transfers and credit card payments
3. **Better Control:** Full editing capabilities for credit cards and transactions
4. **Improved Learning:** AI training from credit card transaction categorization
5. **Visual Appeal:** Brand-specific card icons enhance user experience

### For Developers
1. **Clean Architecture:** Minimal changes, focused on specific features
2. **Well Tested:** Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
3. **Extensible:** Easy to add more card types or detection rules
4. **Maintainable:** Clear separation of concerns, modular design

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- No migration required - new features are additive
- Existing transactions and cards continue to work
- Run `detect_internal_transfers()` once to mark historical transfers
- Run `detect_credit_card_payments()` once to mark historical payments

### Data Integrity
- All updates preserve existing data
- New fields default to null/false if not set
- Backward compatible with previous versions

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Recurring Transfer Detection:** Identify scheduled monthly transfers
2. **Smart Payment Scheduling:** Suggest optimal credit card payment dates
3. **Category Rules:** Allow users to define custom detection keywords
4. **Multi-Currency:** Support for foreign currency credit cards
5. **Statement Import:** Direct import from credit card PDF statements
6. **Interest Calculation:** Track interest charges on carried balances
7. **Rewards Tracking:** Monitor cashback and points per card

## Performance Considerations

### Detection Algorithms
- Transfer detection: O(n¬≤) worst case, optimized with early exits
- Payment detection: O(n) linear time
- Both run once per import, not on every page load

### UI Responsiveness
- Pattern-matching callbacks for scalable card management
- Lazy loading of transaction details
- Efficient data filtering in callbacks

## Conclusion

Sprint 7 successfully delivers:
- ‚úÖ Internal transfer detection and exclusion from forecasts
