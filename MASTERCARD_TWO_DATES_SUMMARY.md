# Mastercard Two-Date Enhancement Summary

## Overview

This enhancement adds support for importing and using BOTH transaction dates from Mastercard CSV exports:
- **Datum** (Transaction Date): When the purchase was actually made
- **Bokfört** (Posting Date): When the transaction was posted to the statement

## Why Two Dates Matter

Credit card transactions have a natural lag between when you make a purchase and when it appears on your statement. For accurate balance tracking and cashflow management, it's critical to use the **posting date** (Bokfört), while the **transaction date** (Datum) is valuable for analyzing spending patterns.

### Example Scenario
```
You buy groceries on October 15 (Datum: 2025-10-15)
The transaction posts to your statement on October 17 (Bokfört: 2025-10-17)

For balance calculations:
- Balance on Oct 16 = Previous balance (transaction not yet posted)
- Balance on Oct 18 = Previous balance + grocery amount (transaction has posted)

For spend analysis:
- You spent the money on Oct 15 (actual purchase date)
- Useful for weekly/monthly spending trends
```

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Data Model Enhancement
**File:** `modules/core/credit_card_manager.py`

Added `posting_date` field to transaction model:
```python
transaction = {
    'id': tx_id,
    'date': date,              # Transaction date (Datum)
    'posting_date': posting_date,  # Posting date (Bokfört)
    'description': description,
    'amount': amount,
    # ... other fields
}
```

### 2. CSV Import Update
**File:** `modules/core/credit_card_manager.py`

Enhanced `import_transactions_from_csv()` to:
- Map Swedish column "Bokfört" to `posting_date`
- Parse both date columns
- Default to transaction date if posting date missing (backward compatibility)

```python
column_mapping = {
    'datum': 'date',
    'bokfört': 'posting_date',  # NEW
    # ... other mappings
}
```

### 3. Balance Calculation Methods

#### Updated `add_transaction()`
Now accepts `posting_date` parameter and stores it in the transaction.

#### New Method: `calculate_balance_at_date()`
```python
def calculate_balance_at_date(self, card_id: str, as_of_date: str, 
                              use_posting_date: bool = True) -> float:
    """Calculate balance at a specific date.
    
    IMPORTANT: For accurate balance, always use posting_date=True
    """
```

This method allows:
- Calculating historical balances
- Verifying balance accuracy
- Supporting statement reconciliation

### 4. Transaction Filtering Enhancement

Updated `get_transactions()` to support filtering by either date:
```python
def get_transactions(self, card_id: str, 
                    start_date: Optional[str] = None,
                    end_date: Optional[str] = None,
                    use_posting_date: bool = False) -> List[Dict]:
```

**Use Cases:**
- `use_posting_date=True`: Get transactions that posted in a date range (for statements)
- `use_posting_date=False`: Get transactions made in a date range (for spending analysis)

### 5. UI Enhancement
**File:** `dashboard/dashboard_ui.py`

Updated credit card transaction table to display both dates:
- Column "Datum (Köp)" shows transaction date
- Column "Bokfört" shows posting date
- Added helpful tooltip explaining the difference

## Testing

### New Test Cases
**File:** `tests/test_mastercard_workflow.py`

Added 3 comprehensive tests:

1. **test_transaction_and_posting_dates**
   - Verifies both dates are imported from CSV
   - Checks that dates can differ
   - Validates proper storage

2. **test_balance_calculated_by_posting_date**
   - Confirms balance uses posting_date, not transaction date
   - Tests edge cases where dates differ significantly
   - Validates `calculate_balance_at_date()` method

3. **test_filtering_by_posting_date**
   - Tests filtering by transaction date
   - Tests filtering by posting date
   - Ensures different results when dates differ

### Test Results
```
✅ All 14 Mastercard workflow tests pass
✅ All 16 credit card manager tests pass
✅ All 30 credit-related tests pass
✅ Dashboard UI loads successfully
```

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation is fully backward compatible:
- Old transactions without `posting_date` will default to using `date`
- All existing tests continue to pass
- API changes are additive (new optional parameters)
- CSV imports without "Bokfört" column still work

## Documentation Updates

Updated `MASTERCARD_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with:
- Explanation of two date fields
- Balance calculation rules
- Usage examples for both dates
- Best practices for date selection

## Usage Examples

### Importing CSV with Both Dates
```python
# CSV has both Datum and Bokfört columns
result = cc_manager.import_transactions_from_csv(
    card_id=card['id'],
    csv_path='mastercard_statement.csv'
)
# Both dates automatically imported and stored
```

### Manual Transaction with Both Dates
```python
cc_manager.add_transaction(
    card_id=card['id'],
    date='2025-10-15',           # When purchased
    posting_date='2025-10-17',   # When posted
    description='ICA Supermarket',
    amount=-1000.0
)
```

### Balance at Specific Date
```python
# Get balance at Oct 20 using posting dates (accurate for statements)
balance = cc_manager.calculate_balance_at_date(
    card_id=card['id'],
    as_of_date='2025-10-20',
    use_posting_date=True  # IMPORTANT: Use posting date for balance
)
```

### Filtering Transactions
```python
# Get October spending (by transaction date)
oct_spending = cc_manager.get_transactions(
    card_id=card['id'],
    start_date='2025-10-01',
    end_date='2025-10-31',
    use_posting_date=False  # Use transaction date for spend analysis
)

# Get October statement transactions (by posting date)
oct_statement = cc_manager.get_transactions(
    card_id=card['id'],
    start_date='2025-10-01',
    end_date='2025-10-31',
    use_posting_date=True  # Use posting date for statement matching
)
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Balance Calculations
**ALWAYS use posting_date** for balance calculations because:
- This is when transactions actually affect the statement
- This is what the bank uses for billing
- This ensures reconciliation with official statements
- This determines payment due dates

### 2. Spend Analysis
**Use transaction_date** for spend analysis because:
- This reflects when you actually made purchases
- Better for budgeting and spending patterns
- More intuitive for daily expense tracking
- Useful for weekly/monthly trend analysis

### 3. Statement Reconciliation
**Use posting_date** to match official statements:
- Filter transactions by posting_date range
- Calculate balance using posting_date
- Compare with statement closing balance

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Balance Tracking**: Balance always matches official statements
2. **Better Spend Analysis**: Understand when you actually made purchases
3. **Flexible Reporting**: Choose date type based on analysis needs
4. **Statement Reconciliation**: Easy to match with bank statements
5. **Cashflow Accuracy**: Know exactly when transactions hit your account

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- UI toggle to switch between date views in dashboard
- Charts showing transaction vs posting date lag
- Automatic detection of delayed postings
- Alerts for unusual posting delays

## Conclusion

This enhancement brings the Mastercard import system in line with how credit cards actually work in the real world, where there's always a delay between making a purchase and it appearing on your statement. By tracking and using both dates appropriately, users get:
- Accurate balances that match their statements
- Better insights into their actual spending patterns
- Flexibility to analyze data from different perspectives
